                <p>Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar 
                    part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a 
                    vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing 
                    across her soul's summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it
                     was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate,
                      which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just
                       having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her
                        firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.</p>
                        <br>
