    <!-- Note:Html structure is very important while making projects.
        Every file has one and only one HTML(<html></html>) element and this element represents the entire webpage.
        Html element is designed to contain one head element and body element and everything on our webpage is supposed go either inside the head or body element.
        body elements contains all the elements that are visible on the page like paragraph button anker tag elements all shoud inside body element.
        On head element it contains all elements that are not visible on the page like title element.
        Its better to make separate folders for css js and so on.
